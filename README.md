## RNASeq Hands on training 2015
==========

Code developped for the 2015 sessions.

Full information about the RNASeq hands-on training can be found on our WIKI <http://wiki.bits.vib.be> in the dedicated pages starting at <http://wiki.bits.vib.be/index.php/Hands-on_introduction_to_NGS_RNASeq_DE_analysis>.

The code posted here will be maintained and might be different from that cointained in the virtualbox image used during the training.

This repo presents two folders for 

* [RNAseq-training/tree/master/scripts scripts]: code relative to the unix command-line manipulation of the reads (QC, mapping, post-processing, ...)
* [RNAseq-training/tree/master/Rscripts Rscripts]:  the R/bioconductor analysis of the gene counts obtained from the mapping of the reads (EdgeR, Deseq2, RobiNA, ...)
